# Episode 2: PE Code Injection

In this episode, there will be 2 chapters:

* [Chapter 1: Code Injection](https://github.com/0r3o-r3vEr5e/Episode-2-PE-Code-Injector/blob/main/Chapter_1.md)

This chapter mainly focus on how to add code into a 32-bit Portable Executable (PE32) and run it before the original PE32 actually starts.
I have just written it in Vietnamese and... meh, I'm a bit lazy to translate to English (Vietnamese is my mother tongue)

* [Chapter 2: Directory Infection ](https://github.com/0r3o-r3vEr5e/Episode-2-PE-Code-Injector/blob/main/Chapter_2.md)

In this chapter, I am doing the same thing as [Chapter 1](https://github.com/0r3o-r3vEr5e/Episode-2-PE-Code-Injector/blob/main/Chapter_1.md) but with all PE32 available in a directory.
The programming language mainly used in this chapter is MASM32.

Yes, this chapter will be written in English
